# DOTA2v2
View the DOTA2v2 on the workshop [here](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2676466935)
## Description
Imagine DOTA but with a map intended for 2v2 and 4v4.

DOTA2v2 makes minor tweaks to DOTA, \
so gold / xp are scaled for 2v2 and 4v4 \
so games are 20 minutes long \
so games are more fun to play.

Sounds similar to turbo, what's different? \
DOTA2v2 shines with its map, \
so games are fun yet balanced \
so games are more about crazy battles \
and less walking around. 

Each game is unique! \
With a 'random draft' inspired pick phase, \
A random hero pool is chosen each game \
so each game requires different strategy

Don't have an even number of players? \
DOTA2v2 adds (gold / xp / creep) buffs \
to the team with less players so that \
you can still play with 3, 5 or 7 players!
